The following is a description of the data used, all of them of public use:

. Piezometric database. Composed by the information associated to the
	piezometers '104080065', '104130038', '104170015', '104240124', '114150046' 
	obtained from the Hydrographic Confederation of Guadalquivir (Spain) and the

	'La_Palma_del_Condado', 'Moguer' and 'Niebla' hydrological stations, 
	belonging to the Andalucia Regional Goverment.

. The SAR (Synthetic Apertur Radar) data of ground deformation used
	('sentinel-asc' and 'sentinel-desc') have been obtained from the 147 and 154
	Sentinel-1 satellite tracks, which belongs to the Copernicus program; and
	have been processed through the ESAâ€™s Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP),
	in the framework of the GEP Early Adopters Programme. This processing has been
	carried out with the services of P-SBAS (Parallel Small BAseline Subset)
	services, developed and integrated by CNR-IREA in the GEP.
