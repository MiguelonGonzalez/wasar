    "## 1. Creation of a Model\n",
    "The dinsar package design holds a data **model** as the main object around which all of the program functionalities spin around. This model will include all the DInSAR datasets and databases that are consulted in the study area and is created through the `Model` class. Since the simplest way of analyzing DInSAR deformation points (also called persistent or permanent scatterers; PS) is through their **aggregation into polygons**, the initialization of this class requieres a polygonal spatial file, that should be introduced as a relative path to its ubication. This way, each of these polygons will define the different analysis areas of the model -analogous to [ADA's](https://open.igme.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12468/708/fast_detection_ground_2017.pdf?sequence=1) (Active Deformation Areas), called in the code as **agregados** and hereinafter as *aggregates*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Althoug the correct generation of this aggregates requiere the application of specific point aggregation techniques, a simple way to generate this layer of polygons is through the 'Aggregate Points' tool of QGIS."
